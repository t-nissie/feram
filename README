Dear current and future feram users,

I released feram-0.21.00.tar.xz from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/loto/files/feram/ .

"feram" is a fast molecular dynamics (MD) simulator
for bulk and thin-film ferroelectrics. Its homepage is
http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/ .

From this version 0.21.00, qudratic inter-atomic force
constant (IFC) matrices can be read from .quadratic file.
See feram-0.21.00/src/25example-BaTiO3-read-quadratic/ .

From this version 0.21.00, parameters for GNUPLOT will
be written into .param.gp file, not into .param file.

Currently, a hysteresis loop calculation of *film* with
acoustic_mass_amu goes wrong. A strange peak appears in the beginning.
See src/23example-BaTiO3-new-param-hl-film-acoustic-mass/.
Bulk calculations go very fine.

Enjoy,
-- Takeshi
