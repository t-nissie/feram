Dear current and future feram users,

I released feram-0.20.00.tar.xz from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/loto/files/feram/ .

"feram" is a fast molecular dynamics (MD) simulator
for bulk and thin-film ferroelectrics. Its homepage is
http://loto.sourceforge.net/feram/ .

From this version 0.20.00, if acoustic_mass_amu is
set to the effective mass of acoustic displacements
 acoustic_mass_amu = 46.44
molecular dynamics is performed on acoustic displacements.
(If acoustic_mass_amu is not set, acoustic displacements,
i.e. inhomogeneous strains, are optimized according to the
{u(R)}, in the same way as before.) See README.en or
README.ja.

You cannot use method = 'md' nor 'lf' togeter with
acoustic_mass_amu, currently.

Currently, a hysteresis loop calculation of *film* with
acoustic_mass_amu goes wrong. A strange peak appears in the beginning.
See src/23example-BaTiO3-new-param-hl-film-acoustic-mass/.
Bulk calculations go very fine.

Enjoy,
-- Takeshi
