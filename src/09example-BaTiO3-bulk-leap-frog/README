= Example of leapfrog MD simulations with feram
Leapfrog MD simulations in the microcanonical ensemble
conserve total energy. You can also turn on the MD
of acoustic displacements by setting acoustic_mass_amu.

Temperature is adjusted by init_dipo_dev, the initial
deviation of dipoles.

Because this example does not read the last .coord
file, the plot of strains are not continuous. See
leapfrog16x16x16/strain.pdf .
