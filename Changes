= Changes for feram
== 0.14.03
 * New tag seed, two integers for Marsaglia-Tsang 64-bit uiniversal RNG (random number generator).
   Now, we start to use built-in RNG. "feram foo bar" and "feram bar foo" must have same results.

 * In src/fft.F, HZFT7M() is replaced with HDFZ7M() and HZFD7M() for SR11000.
   ipara = $NUMTHRD() is also employed.

 * src/eigenvalues2j.F
   incorrect: call write_kappa2_and_j_i('     j_1 =', b(0))
   correct:   call write_kappa2_and_j_i('     j_1 =', b(1))
