= Changes for feram
== 0.18.00
 * Quit to use libblaslapack/.

== 0.17.06 (private release)
 * Now you can use -Kimpact for Fujitsu FX1.
   Try "./configure FC=frt --with-fft=ssl2" on FX1.

== 0.17.05 (private release)
 * sum() is removed from mirror_force_mirror.F.

== 0.17.04 (private release)
 * Speed up around -Z* \sum_R E(R).u(R) in mirror_force_mirror.F
   with p%E_field_always_zero.

== 0.17.03 (public release)
 * optimize-homo-strain.F, coord_module.F, elastic.F:
   Introduced homogeneous_G(1:6,1:6) and homogeneous_G_inv(1:6).
   It speeds up 10% for large MDs.

 * cholesky_z.f: Deleted. We do not use it anymore.

== 0.17.01 (not released)
 * optimize-inho-strain.F, coord_module.F: Introduced inhomo_K_G(:,:, :,:,:),
   inhomo_K = G tG, where G is a lower triangular matrix and tG is transpose of G. G(i,4) = 1/G(i,i).
   It speeds up 10% for large systems.

 * cholesky_z.f: Deleted. We do not use it anymore.

== 0.17.00 (not released)
 * verbose tag. verbose = 0, 1, or 2.
   Now, you cannot use --disable-detailed-messages configure option.

== 0.16.01 (public release)
 * Use foo.localfield file instead of local.field.

 * You can use both foo123 and foo123.feram for the input parameter file.

== 0.15.01 (public release)
 * README.ja, a Japanese document is ready.

 * feram_mpi.F, MPI job parallel. You can "make feram_mpi".

 * feram does not read from stdin anymore.

 * Log goes to foo.log, not to stdout anymore.

== 0.14.06 (private release)
 * New tag seed, two integers for Marsaglia-Tsang 64-bit uiniversal RNG (random number generator).
   Now, we start to use built-in RNG. "feram foo bar" and "feram bar foo" must have same results.

 * In src/fft.F, HZFT7M() is replaced with HDFZ7M() and HZFD7M() for SR11000.
   ipara = $NUMTHRD() is also employed.

 * src/eigenvalues2j.F
   incorrect: call write_kappa2_and_j_i('     j_1 =', b(0))
   correct:   call write_kappa2_and_j_i('     j_1 =', b(1))

 * src/feram.F
   SR11000 can also use iargc() and getarg().
   We do not need FILES file for SR11000 anymore!

 * dVddi-unharmonic.F and energy_module.F
   Add PSUM() directives for SR11000.

 * Start to write Changes.

== 0.13.05 (public release)
