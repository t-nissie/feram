== What is ferroelectric?
Fig. 1 figures/ferroelectrics.jpg
  Properties of ferroelectrics, such as BaTiO$_3$, PbTiO$_3$, KNbO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$, LiTaO$_3$, SrTiO$_3$, Pb(Zr$_{(1-x)}$Ti$_x$)O$_3$ (PZT), etc..
/Fig.


# First, let me remind you what ferroelectric is.
# As you know,
# ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, SrTiO3, PZT, etc.
# has characteristic properties, for example,
# spontaneous polarization
# phase transition
# piezoelectric effect and
# inverse piezoelectric effect.
#
# You can see both piezoelectric and inverse piezoelectric effects with this demonstrator.
# This white part is PZT.
# If you apply AC voltage, it can be a speaker.
# And it can be a sensor, too.
#
# Here, I'd like to emphasize that
# without long-range dipole-dipole interaction and finite size effects,
# you will not see the domain structure like this.
# In other words, the domain structure is formed to avoid
# depolarization field induced by surface charges.





== Non-volatile ferroelectric memory (FeRAM)

/Fig.


# Such ferroelectrics are currently used in Non-volatile ferroelectric memory, FeRAM.
# They are schematic device configurations and their circuit diagrams.
# This one called 1-transistor and 1-capacitor type and
# this DRAM like configuration called 1-transistor type.
# Both of them has ferroelectric thin-film capacitors.




== Ferroelectric thin-film capacitors (background of this study)
 * Various applications of ferroelectric thin-films:
   * multilayer capacitors
   * nonvolatile FeRAMs
   * nanoactuators
 * Down-sizing of FeRAMs (nano-capacitors of ferroelectric
   thin films) is highly demanded.
 * Epitaxially constraint ferroelectric films made by PLD.
 * Effect of imperfect screening of electrodes is NOT well understood.
   * [M. Dawber et al.: J. Phys. Condes. Matter <b>15</b>, L393 (2003)]
 * Fatigue causes damages in polarization behaviors of ferroelectric capacitors.

/Fig.


# I explain the background of this study with following two slides.
# There are various applications of ferroelectric thin films.





== Dynamics, nanosize effects and temperature dependences
 * <b>Dynamics</b> of ferroelectric thin-film capacitors:
   * Hysteresis loop
   * Polarization switching
   * Dynamics of domain wall
 * Their <b>nanosize effects</b> and <b>temperature dependences</b> remain poorly known.
   * Experimentally, <em>in situ</em> observations are difficult.
   * Theoretically,
     * The long-range Coulomb interaction limits the size
       and time of molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations.
     * How to include depolarization fields caused by imperfect electrodes
       was unclear.

Fig. 1 figures/Fong.jpg
  After [Fong et al.: Science <b>304</b>, 1650 (2004)]. Ultra thin films ($< 4$ layers) may not have spontaneous polarization.
/Fig.


# There are many dynamical behaviors in ferroelectric thin-film capacitors.
# For example, Hysteresis loop, polarization switching, and
# dynamics of domain wall.
#
# For example, this is ...





== Purpose of this study
 * Development of fast molecular dynamics (MD) code which can simulate
   ferroelectric thin-film capacitors for
   a realistic system size (up to 100 nm) and
   a realistic time span ($>$ 1 ns).
 * Clarify the effect of dead layers between ferroelectrics and electrodes.
 * Predict the effect of the compressive strain arising from epitaxial constraints.

$\to$ We develop "feram" code.

# Again, one of the purposes of this simulation program is to study
# the thermal properties
# of ferroelectric thin film and its capacitors.
#
# Ferroelectric thin-film capacitors are applied, in for example, non-volatile FeRAM.
# And their down-sizing are highly demanded.
#
# Fatigue of electrodes of capacitors is a current big problem
#
# But their Hysteresis, polarization switching, dynamics of domain wall
# and their nano-size effects are not well known.
#
# This is an example of experimental study of thin films.
# Fong et al. studied PbTiO3 thin films' striped ferroelectric domain structure
# with strong X-ray. They found thickness dependence of Tc.
#
# Basically, experimental {\em in situ} observations of such dynamics are difficult.
#
# But you can do simulation with feram.

== Soft-mode displacements of perovskite type ferroelectrics <em>AB</em>O<sub>3</sub>
# [King-Smith and Vanderbilt: Phys. Rev. B <b>49</b> 5828 (1994)] Parametrization of coupling between soft-mode displacement and strains.

Fig. 1 figures/perovskite-contours.jpg
  Coupling between atomic displacements and strains. After [T. Hashimoto, T. Nishimatsu et al.: Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. <b>43</b>, 6785 (2004)].
/Fig.

Eq. 1
    u_{\alpha}^2 = \{v_{\alpha}^A\}^2 + \{v_{\alpha}^B\}^2 + \{v_{\alpha}^{\rm O_{I}}\}^2 + \{v_{\alpha}^{\rm O_{II}}\}^2 + \{v_{\alpha}^{\rm O_{III}}\}^2
/Eq.


# The origin of electric polarization of perovskite type ferroelectrics ABO3 is its Soft-mode displacement.
# And the atomic displacement is strongly coupled with strains.
# This is the cubic high temperature crystal structure of ABO3.
# Unit cell has 5 atoms. So atomic displacements spans a 3x5=15-dimensional space.
# This is a 2-dimensional subspace of the 15-dimensional space of atomic displacements.
# In the 2-dimensional subspace, potential surface is plotted.
# If there is strain in crystal, the potential minimum goes far from its origin and get deeper.
#
# With first-principles calculations, you can investigate such potential surface and then construct the effective Hamiltonian.
# In this paper, I described how to trace this valley line automatically with first-principles calculations.
# This is very useful to construct the effective Hamiltonian.

== Coarse-graining
 * Real perovskite-like system has $15N+6$ degree of freedom
   * $N$ unit cells in a supercell
   * 5 atoms per unit cell
   * Each atom can move along 3 directions
   * 6 components of strain

 * Simplified model has $6N+6$ degree of freedom
   * Define 1 dipole $Z^*\bm{u}(\bm{R})$ per unit cell
   * 1 acoustic displacement (Inhomogeneous strain) $\bm{w}(\bm{R})$ per unit cell

Fig. 1 figures/CoarseGraining.jpg
/Fig.

# In the Hamiltonian, Coarse-graining is employed.
# In other words, the number of degree of freedom is reduced.
#
# Real perovskite-like system has 15N+6 degree of freedom,
# where N is the number of unit cells in supercell,
# because each unit cell has 5 atoms, each atom can move along 3 directions,
# and there are 6 components of homogeneous strain.
#
# For Fast and Simple simulation, we reduce the number of degree of freedom to 6N+6,
# by replacing 5 atoms to 2 vectors, 1 dipole Z^*u(R) and 1 acoustic displacement
# per unit cell.
#






== First-principles effective Hamiltonian for a supercell
Supercell of ($AB$O<sub>3</sub>)$_N$ with $\{\bm{u}(\bm{R})\}$ and $\{\bm{w}(\bm{R})\}$:
Eq. 1
    H^{\rm eff}
    = \frac{M^*_{\rm dipole}}{2} \sum_{\bm{R},\alpha}\dot{u}_\alpha^2(\bm{R})
    + \frac{M^*_{\rm acoustic}}{2}\sum_{\bm{R},\alpha}\dot{w}_\alpha^2(\bm{R})
    + V^{\rm self}(\{\bm{u}\})+V^{\rm dpl}(\{\bm{u}\})+V^{\rm short}(\{\bm{u}\})
    + V^{\rm elas,\,homo}(\eta_1,...,\eta_6)+V^{\rm elas,\,inho}(\{\bm{w}\})
    + V^{\rm coup,\,homo}(\{\bm{u}\}, \eta_1,...,\eta_6)+V^{\rm coup,\,inho}(\{\bm{u}\}, \{\bm{w}\})
    - Z^*\sum_{\bm{R}} \mathscr{E} \cdot \bm{u}(\bm{R})
/Eq.

Fig. 1 figures/arrows.jpg
  Snapshot of the supercell. Strengths and directions of $\{\bm{u}(\bm{R})\}$ are indicated with arrows. red and blue colors represent $+z$-polarized and $-z$-polarized sites.
/Fig.



# Using that parameters, we can construct an effective Hamiltonian for a supercell with
# N unit cells of ABO3.
#
# This is a snapshot of an MD simulation. u(R)s are indicated with arrows.
# We do time evolution of this Hamiltonian of this supercell.






== Self potential of a local dipole
Eq. 1
    V^{\rm self}(\bm{u})=\kappa_2 u^2 + \alpha u^4 + \gamma(u_{y}^2u_{z}^2+u_{z}^2u_{x}^2+u_{x}^2u_{y}^2)
/Eq.

where

Eq. 1
    u^2=u_{x}^2 + u_{y}^2 + u_{z}^2.
/Eq.

Fig. 1 figures/fourth.jpg
  Schematic illustration of self potential of a local dipole. Double well is made by the fourth order terms of u.
/Fig.



# I shall introduce you some terms of the effective Hamiltonian.
# The self potential of a local dipole or On-site local potential has fourth order terms of u.
# It makes double well like this for u.

== Dipole-dipole interaction
In the effective Hamiltonian, dipole-dipole interactions are separated into the long-rage term and the short-range term.

Long-range:
Eq. 1
    V^{\rm dpl}(\{\bm{u}\}) = 
    \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_\alpha \sum_{j=1}^N \sum_\beta
    u_\alpha(\bm{R}_i) \Phi_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{R}_{ij}) u_\beta(\bm{R}_j),
/Eq.

Eq. 2
     \Phi_{\alpha\beta}(\bm{R}_{ij})= \frac{Z^{*2}}{\epsilon_\infty}\sum_{\bm{n}}{}'
     \frac{\delta_{\alpha\beta} - 3(\widehat{\bm{R}_{ij}+\bm{n}})_\alpha(\widehat{\bm{R}_{ij}+\bm{n}})_\beta}{|{\bm{R}_{ij}+\bm{n}}|^3},
/Eq.

$\bm{n}$ is the supercell lattice vector:
Eq. 3
     n_\alpha = \cdots, -2{L_\alpha} a_0, -{L_\alpha} a_0, 0, {L_\alpha} a_0, 2{L_\alpha} a_0,\cdots 
/Eq.

Short-range:
Eq. 4
     V^{\rm shrt}(\{\bm{u}\})=
     \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N \sum_\alpha \sum_j^{\rm 3nn} \sum_\beta
     u_\alpha(\bm{R}_i) \,J_{ij,\alpha\beta}\, u_\beta(\bm{R}_j)
/Eq.
$J_{ij,\alpha\beta} = J_k$: Short-range interaction matrix ($k=1,\cdots,7$)


# In the effective Hamiltonian, dipole-dipole interactions are separated into the long-rage term and the short-range term.
# Both has quadratic form.
# But long-range one must be summed-up for very far periodic supercells 
# Short range one is local.
# 

== Forces on dipoles are calculated in the reciprocal space
Fig. 1 figures/flow.jpg
  Simplified flow chart for calculating forces on dipoles. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and inverse FFT (IFFT) enable the rapid calculation of long-range dipole-dipole interactions. You can reduce computational time from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$.
/Fig.


# Time consuming part in simulation is the calculation of forces of dipoles because
# dipole-dipole interactions are long-range. ..... You can reduce computational time
# from O(N^2) to O(NlogN).

== Long-range dipole-dipole interaction
Fig. 1 figures/bulk32x32x32.dipole-dipole-long.interaction.jpg
  Long-range interaction energy per unit cell is plotted in the first Brillouin zone for the simple cubic crystal. Only with dipole-dipole interaction, the minimum is at the M point, i.e., the checker-board-type antiferroelectric order is most stable.
/Fig.


== Long-range + short-range interaction
Fig. 1 figures/bulk32x32x32.dipole-dipole-long+short.interaction.jpg
  By introducing short-range interaction, the minimum come to the $\Gamma$ point, i.e., the ferroelectric order is most stable.
/Fig.


== First Brillouin zone for simple cubic crystals

== LO-TO splitting
LO-TO splitting is the ion version of the plasma frequency.

Fig. 1 figures/oscillation.jpg
  Schematic illustration of longitudinal oscillation of a dielectric thin film. Polarization $P_z=Z^* u_z / \Omega$ perpendicular to the film causes surface charges $\pm P_z$. The surface charges result in depolarization field $E_{\rm d}=-4\pi P_z$ in the film. This depolarization field causes restoring force $F=-4\pi Pz Z^* u_z=-4\pi Z^{*2} u_z^2 / \Omega$ on $u_z$.
/Fig.


#The surface charges result in depolarization field $E_{\rm d}=-\frac{4\pi}{\epsilon_\infty} P_z$ in the film. This depolarization field causes restoring force $F=-\frac{4\pi}{\epsilon_\infty} Pz Z^* u_z=-\frac{4\pi}{\epsilon_\infty} Z^{*2} u_z^2 / \Omega$ on $u_z$.


== Boundary condition for capacitors
Fig. 1 figures/capacitor.jpg
  Ferroelectrics are sandwiched between short-circuited perfect electrodes (a) and imperfect electrodes (b). In (a) depolarization field $E_{\rm d}=0$, but in (b) $E_{\rm d}=-4\pi P_z \frac{d}{l+d}$.
/Fig.


# This slide show you how to simulate thin films
# sandwiched between short-circuited electrodes.
# As we learned when we were under-graduate students,
# An electrode act like a mirror for charges.
# So two parallel electrodes act like two parallel mirrors.
# You have infinite mirror images beyond the mirrors.
# Such configuration can simulate with doubled-size supercell
# which have TWO l thickness.
#
# moreover, if you introduce a gap d in the doubled-size supercell,
# you can automatically simulate damaged or imperfect electrodes.

== Out-of-plane polarization is no longer the ground state
Fig. 1 figures/damaged.jpg
  Vertical cross section of a simulated ferroelectric "free" film capacitor with a single dead layer; 16 x 16 x (l=63, d=1). The snapshot was taken at the point marked "x". The projection of the dipole moments onto the xz-plane are indicated with arrows.

== Epitaxially constrained film vs. "free" film (again)
Fig. 1 figures/epit-vs-free.jpg
  Schematic comparison between the epitaxially constrained film and the ``free'' film. In the epitaxially constrained film, switching may have to climb over a potential barrier, but, in the ``free'' film, dipoles can be easily rotated and switching can go around a valley of the potential.

== Future plan with the feram code: Molecular dynamics simulations of relaxors
Relaxors Pb$B'_x$$B''_{1-x}$O$_3$: Pb$^{2+}$
 * Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$ (PSN): Sc$^{3+}$, Nb$^{5+}$
 * Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$)O$_3$ (PST): Sc$^{3+}$, Ta$^{5+}$
 * Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$ (PMN:) Mg$^{2+}$, Nb$^{5+}$
 * $(1-x)$Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-xPbTiO$_3$ (PMN-$x$PT): Mg$^{2+}$, Nb$^{5+}$, Ti$^{4+}$
 * Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Ta$_{2/3}$)O$_3$ (PMT): Mg$^{2+}$, Ta$^{5+}$
 * Pb(Zn$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$ (PZN): Zn$^{2+}$, Nb$^{5+}$
The averaged valence number of B-site ions $B'_x$ and $B''_{1-x}$ is $4+$.

# Most characteristic and still mysterious property of relaxors is 
#Eq.1
#\tan\delta=\tan()
#/Eq.






== Crystal structures of relaxors
Fig. 1 figures/RandallBhallaFig3.jpg
  (a) Ordered B-site structure of $AB'_xB''_{(1-x)}$O$_3$. In the case of Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$, Sc and Nb has the NaCl structure. In the case of Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$, the Na-site is randomly occupied by Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{1/6}$ and the Cl-site is occupied by  Nb$_{1/2}$.  (b) Disordered structure. B-sites is occupied by $B'$ and $B''_{(1-x)}$ randomly. After [C. A. Randall and A. S. Bhalla: Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. <b>29</b>, 327-333 (1990)].

== Snapshot of a simulation of PSN relaxor
Fig. 1 figures/SilviaFig1.jpg
  A (110) plane through the PSN simulation box representing the projected local field (arbitrary units) at each Pb site in the plane. Chemically ordered regions (approximately circular) have small approximately homogeneous fields, and chemically disordered regions have larger more varied and disordered local fields. After [Tinte, Burton, Cockayne and Waghmare: Phys. Rev. Lett. <b>97</b>, 137601 (2006)].
/Fig.







== Frequency dependence of dielectric constant
Eq. (Fluctuation-dissipation theorem)
\epsilon(\omega) - \epsilon_\infty = \frac{1}{3\epsilon_0 V k_B T}\left[ \left\langle \bm{p}^2 \right\rangle + i\omega \int_{0}^{\infty} dt e^{i\omega t} \left\langle \bm{p}(t) \cdot \bm{p}(0) \right\rangle \right]
/Eq.
where $\bm{p}(t)$ is the total electric dipole moment in the supercell at time $t$,

Eq. (Total electric dipole moment in the supercell)
\bm{p}(t)=Z^*\sum_{\bm{R}} \bm{u}(\bm{R};t) .
/Eq.


Estimation of computational time

32x32x32 unit cells, $\Delta t = 2$ fs, [AMD64 1.8GHz dual core] or [SR11000 1 node = 16 cores]

1THz, $T=1\,$ps,            500 steps,  54 sec  or 8.4 sec.

1GHz, $T=1\,$ns,        500,000 steps, 900 min. or 140 min.

1MHz, $T=1\mu$s,    500,000,000 steps, 620 days or  97 days

So, I am planning to calculate and compare $\epsilon(\omega)$ for $\omega/(2\pi)$ = 10M ... 10GHz.


# If you apply external electric field at site R' at time t', dipole at R,t responses
# through this equation with real-space-and-time susceptibility tensor chi(R-R',t-t').
# You can simplify it by Fourier transformation and get q-omega expression.
# And then, if you apply the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to it, you may get
# the imaginary part of chi. Then with Kramers-Kronig relation, you can get the real part.
