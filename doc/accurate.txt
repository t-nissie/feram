== Classification of insulators by their dielectric properties
Fig. 1 figures/classification.jpg
  All insulators can be classified by their dielectric properties.
  All insulators are dielectrics.
  Some of them are piezoelectrics.
  Some of them are pyroelectrics.
  Some of them are ferroelectrics,
  though difference between pyroelectrics and ferroelectrics is controversial.
  Especially, perovskite-type ferroelectrics based on BaTiO3 and Pb(Zr$_{(1-x)}$Ti$_x$)O$_3$ (PZT)
  have good properties of all of them for applications.

== What is ferroelectric?
Fig. 1 figures/ferroelectrics.jpg
  Spontaneous polarization of ferroelectrics
  can have some directions according to their crystal structures.
  Therefore, the spontaneous polarization can be
  switchable by an external electric field,
  the $P$-$E$ curve has hysteresis,
  and finite-size ferroelectrics exhibit domain structures.
  Ferroelectrics also have phase transitions and
  large piezoelectricity and inverse-piezoelectricity.

== Procedure of Molecular dynamics simulations of ferroelectrics
 * Target ferroelectrics = BaTiO3.
 * Investigate it with first-principles calculation.
   * Construct an effective Hamiltonian with 25 parameters.
   * Using ABINIT http://www.abinit.org/ with an original patch.
   * Limited small cell size, 1-8 unit cells.
   * Only properties under zero Kelvin can be calculated.
 * Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian.
   * Original feram code http://loto.sf.net/feram/ .
   * Realistic system size (up to 100 nm).
   * Realistic time span ($>$ 1 ns).
   * Various conditions: temperature, pressure, bulk or thin-film, externally applied electric field

 * Scientific features
   * Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian
   * $AB$O<sub>3</sub>-type perovskite ferroelectrics and relaxors
   * Uses supercell; ($AB$O<sub>3</sub>)$_N$, $N=32\times 32\times 512$ $\Rightarrow$ 2,621,440 atoms
   * Coarse-graining; reduction of the number of degree of freedom

   * Applications:
     * Phase transition of bulk ferroelectrics
     * Capacitor, <b>ferroelectric thin film</b> is sandwiched between short-circuited electrodes

# Other features of feram program are:
# Its Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation uses first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian.
# It can simulate ABO3-type perovskite ferroelectrics and relaxors
# It can use big size of supercell up to 32x32x512. It corresponds to 2,621,440 atoms.
# It can do such a huge calculation because it employs some kind of Coarse-graining that
# reduces the number of degree of freedom of the system.
# and because Long-range dipole-dipole interaction is treated
# in reciprocal-space using k-locality of the force matrix
#
# Using this program, you can simulate
# Phase transition of bulk ferroelectrics and properties of
# capacitors in which ferroelectric thin film is sandwiched between short-circuited electrodes.
# Today, I will mainly show you our study of ferroelectric thin films.
#
# This program is fast, because it uses a fast FFT library and
# it is parallelized with OpenMP.
# I usually use normal Linux personal computers.
# But you can also use feram on some supercomputers.
# You can freely download feram from this site.


== Background and Purpose of this study
=== Background of this study
 * LDA underestimate lattice constants slightly (1-2%)
 * Double-well total-energy surfaces for zone-center distortions of
   $AB$O$_3$ perovskite-type ferroelectrics are shallower
   than the depths expected from their observed transition
   temperatures ($T_{\rm C}=403 \rm{K}=0.0347 {\rm eV}$ for BaTiO$_3$).
 * Wu and Cohen introduced a new accurate GGA
   and obtained good agreement between calculated and experimentally observed lattice
   constants.

=== Purpose of this study
 * Calculate accurate total-energy surfaces for zone-center distortions of BaTiO$_3$, PbTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$
   with GGA (Wu and Cohen).
 * Construct new set of parameters for effective Hamiltonian of BaTiO$_3$
 * Perform new MD simulation of  BaTiO$_3$

== Summary

   distortions.
 * New set of parameters of effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$.
 * Effect of thermal expansion cannot be ignored
   to reproduce properties in the whole range of temperature ($30-450$~K).
